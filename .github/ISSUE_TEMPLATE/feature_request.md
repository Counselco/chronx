## Problem Statement

Describe the problem or limitation you are trying to solve. What can you not do today that you want to be able to do?

## Proposed Solution

Describe the feature or change you are proposing. Be as specific as possible. If this involves a consensus change (new transaction type, new field on a core type, new validation rule), note that explicitly — consensus changes require extra scrutiny.

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches did you consider? Why is your proposed solution better?

## Impact

- Does this require a re-genesis or protocol upgrade?
- Does this break backward compatibility with stored data?
- Does this affect the wallet, node, RPC API, or multiple components?

## Additional Context

Any other context, links, prior art, or related issues that would help reviewers evaluate this proposal.
